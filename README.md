# CHORD ANALYSER

Experimental heuristic functions to analyse the FFT of any audio and detect chords!

To run, run the app on a local server (Tone.js doesn't work if you run the file independently)
```python -m http.server```

On your browser, go to 0.0.0.0:8000.

To run on a different port, run
```python -m http.server <port>```
